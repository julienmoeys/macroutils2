Title: R Utility Functions for the MACRO and SOILNDB Models
Description: Read, write, convert, display and plot the content of binary files from the models MACRO and SOILNDB. Miscellaneous utility functions related MACRO, such as bug-fixes. macroutils2 is the continuation of macroutils, but there is not full backward compatibility (some functions' argument were changed or renamed). macroutils2 can read both MACRO output files and MACRO "intermediate files" for metabolites.
