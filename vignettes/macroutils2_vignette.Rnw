\section{Introduction} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{What is \texttt{macroutils2}?} 

\texttt{macroutils2} is an R\cite{RDCT2011} package (library) 
providing utility functions to work with 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_files}{binary files} 
that are inputted or outputted by the solute transport models 
\href{http://www.slu.se/sv/centrumbildningar-och-projekt/vattennav/vara-modeller/soilndb/}{
SOILNDB}\cite{SOILNDB2002} and \href{http://www.slu.se/en/collaborative-centres-and-projects/centre-for-chemical-pesticides-ckb1/areas-of-operation-within-ckb/models/macro-52/}{
MACRO}\cite{MACRO2012}.\\


Main features implemented in this package:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read binary files (i.e. import them into R). Batch import is 
        possible;
    \item Write binary files (i.e. export R tables as binary files 
        that can be read by \texttt{SOILNDB} or \texttt{MACRO}).
    \item Convert binary files into text files (CSV or similar 
        formats). Batch converstion is possible;
    \item Plot some of the variables from one or several binary 
        files as a time series graph;
    \item View the content of one binary file in a user friendly 
        tabular format.
    \item Reading, converting, plotting and viewing binary files 
        can be achieved with a \textit{rudimentary} graphical user 
        interface (generally text based), driving the user through 
        a series of options;
\end{itemize}



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Install and load \texttt{macroutils2}} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Requirements} 

To install and use \texttt{macroutils2}, you need:



\begin{itemize}
    \item An MS Windows computer. The package will most probably also 
        work on Unix (Linux) or Mac computers, but we can not provide 
        support for this, as it requires to build the package 
        from sources (sources are available upon request);
    \item A recent version of R, already installed on your computer 
        (see below). Check which version of R is required on the 
        package homepage. R is free and open-source. 
    \item The latest version of \texttt{macroutils2} (see below);
\end{itemize}



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Install R} 

R\footnote{R: 'R is a language and environment for statistical 
computing and graphics'} installer for Windows can be obtained on R website 
\url{http://www.r-project.org/}.\\

From R homepage, go to the \texttt{CRAN}.\footnote{CRAN: 
'Comprehensive R Archive Network', a network of server hosting 
R installation files and R packages} homepage 
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/} or choose the nearest CRAN mirror 
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html}.\\

From there, choose 'Download R for Windows', and then choose 'base' 
or 'install R for the first time'.\\

Download the latest R installer, and install it (follow the 
instructions)\footnote{We don't provide support for R installation!}.\\



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Install the package} 

Windows 'binary' (i.e. installer) for the latest version of the 
package \texttt{macroutils2} can be downloaded on the homepage 
of the model MACRO on 
\href{http://www.slu.se/en/collaborative-centres-and-projects/centre-for-chemical-pesticides-ckb1/areas-of-operation-within-ckb/models/macro-52/}{
CKB website} (or \url{http://www.slu.se/ckb}, choose English 
(top-right), 'Area of operations', 'Models', 'Macro 5.2').\\ 

The package binary files are usually named 
\texttt{macroutils2\_x.y.z.zip}, where \texttt{x}, \texttt{y} and 
\texttt{z} form the version number (major milestone, minor milestone, 
minor revision).\\

Notice that you don't need to uncompress this \texttt{.zip} file! 
(it is an installer).\\

Open R Graphical User Interface, and in the \texttt{packages} menu 
(top menu bar), choose 'Install pacakge(s) from local zip file(s)', 
and select the package binary file (\texttt{macroutils2\_x.y.z.zip}).\\

% \includegraphics[width=585px,height=573px,scale=0.25]{installFromLocalZip.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{installFromLocalZip.png}



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Load the package} 


After you have started R, just type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
library( "macroutils2" ) 
@ 


to load the package. \textbf{Notice that this has to be done 
everytime you start a new R session}.



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Install the package development version from GitHub}

Note: If you are not familiar with R developments, you should probably 
avoid that method, as some complications may arise.\\

A - On Windows computers, install \texttt{Rtools} (see here: 
\url{cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}). Install the version 
that corresponds to your the version of R that is installed on your 
computer.\\

On other machines, read the instructions here: 
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html} 
(Windows users may also have a look at this page).

B - Install the package \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html}{devtools}.\\

\texttt{devtools} is a package develloped by Hadley Wickham to 
install development version of R packages that are hosted on GitHub.

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
install.packages("devtools")
@ 

C - Optionally, \textit{upgrade} the package \texttt{devtools}.

See step 3 in that document: 
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html} 

D - Install the development version of \texttt{macroutils2} (GitHub 
version)

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
devtools::install_github("julienmoeys/macrounchained/pkg/macroutils2")
@ 

The GitHub repository of the package \texttt{macroutils2} can be 
found here: \url{https://github.com/julienmoeys/macrounchained}.\\

Notice that it is not guarantee that the development version will 
compile on all platforms and versions of R.



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\section{Working with \texttt{macroutils2}} 


\textbf{NOTES:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{hashtag symbol(s) \texttt{\#}} (or 
        \texttt{\#\#} no matter how many) in R code examples mean(s) 
        that the code located on the right hand-side of the hashtag 
        symbol(s), on the same line, \textbf{are comments}. They 
        are ignored by R.
    \item All the examples below are R code. It means you need to 
        open R graphical user interface to run these commands;
    \item The 'R console' is the area in R GUI where you can type 
        R commands;
\end{itemize} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Kickstart (graphical user interface)} 


Once the package has been installed, to view the content of some 
binary files, and type: 

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
library( "macroutils2" ) 
macroViewBin() 
@ 

and follow the instructions that appear on R console.\\

To convert some binary files into text files, type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
library( "macroutils2" ) 
macroConvertBin() 
@ 

and follow the instructions that appear on R console.\\

To plot some variables from some binary files, type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
library( "macroutils2" ) 
macroPlot() 
@ 

and follow the instructions that appear on R console.\\

Notice that \texttt{library("macroutils2")} is only needed 
once, and thus will not be repeated later in this tutorial!



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Prepare the example files used in this tutorial} 

Some example bin files are provided with the package. You can 
view them with the following code:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
list.files( 
    path = system.file( "bintest", package = "macroutils2" ), 
    full.names = FALSE, pattern = ".bin", ignore.case = TRUE )  
@ 


For this tutorial, we will only use two of these files. We will 
first copy them in the working directory, in order to avoid 
to alter them accidentally:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
## File name, without the library path
filenm <- c( "output_chat_winCer_GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin", 
    "output_chat_winCer_Met-GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin" ) 
## 
## Find the library path
path <- system.file( "bintest", package = "macroutils2" ) 
## 
## Copy these files in the working directory 
file.copy( 
    from        = file.path( path, filenm ), 
    to          = file.path( getwd(), filenm ), 
    overwrite   = FALSE  ) 
@ 


So you now have two binary files in your working directory:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
file.exists( filenm ) 
@ 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Note on R working directory and file paths} 

R working directory is the place where R looks for input files or 
writes output files, when no path is specified.\\

You can use \texttt{setwd} to change the working directory. Read 
its help page (\texttt{?setwd}).\\

Do not forget that, contrary to windows default behaviour, R does 
not accept file path with single backslash (\textbackslash), as this 
is a special character for R. Use double backslash instead 
(\textbackslash\textbackslash), or single slash (/), or 
double slashes (//). This is also valid for file paths.



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Convert binary files into text files (\texttt{macroConvertBin})} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Graphical user interface} 

Simply type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroConvertBin() 
@ 


... and follow the instructions that appear on the screen, first 
as a pop-up window to choose the file(s) you want to convert, and 
then as a of text menu asking you some details about the convertion 
(symbols used as field separator and as decimal mark).\\

Unless you set the argument \texttt{fileOut}, the output file name(s) 
and extension(s) will be chosen automatically, and the file(s) will 
be written in the working directory.\\

If the file(s) already exists, you will be asked if you want to 
overwrite them or not.\\

It is possible to convert several files at a time with this function.



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{R commands (non-interactive mode)} 

If you want to convert \texttt{"output\_chat\_winCer\_GW-C\_1kgHa\_d298.bin"} using R commands, type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroConvertBin( 
    f   = "output_chat_winCer_GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin", 
    gui = FALSE ) 
@ 


You can customise the file format, for example:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroConvertBin( 
    f       = "output_chat_winCer_GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin", 
    gui     = FALSE,            # No Graphical Interface 
    sep     = ";",              # Field separator 
    dec     = ".",              # Decimal mark 
    fileOut = "output_chat_winCer_GW-C_1kgHa_d298_2.CSV" )   
@ 


Notice that when used non-interactively, \texttt{macroConvertBin} 
overwrites existing output files without warning!



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Batch conversion of multiple files} 

The example below should how to (a) list all the bin 
files in a folder, (b) convert these bin files to \texttt{CSV} 
files and (c) export them in textit{another} folder.

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
#   Location of the directory where the files 
#   are located. Here I take the default bin files in 
#   the package installation directory. Just write the 
#   "path/to/your/own/directory" instead
fDir <- system.file( "bintest", package = "macroutils2" )

#   Location of the directory where the files should 
#   be output. Here I the working directory
dirOut <- getwd()

#   List all the files in fDir
f <- list.files( path = fDir, full.names = FALSE ) 

#   Select only bin files (notice that pattern argument 
#   in list.files() also selects a folder, so we 
#   can't use it here, and use grepl instead)
f <- f[ grepl( x = tolower( f ), pattern = ".bin", 
    fixed = TRUE ) ]

#   Contruct path and name for output files
fOut <- file.path( dirOut, sprintf( "%s.csv", f ) )

#   Add the path to the input files
f <- file.path( fDir, f )

#   Convert the files
macroConvertBin( f = f, fileOut = fOut, gui = FALSE, 
    overwrite = TRUE ) 
@ 

Notice that if \texttt{fileOut} is not set, \texttt{macroConvertBin} 
will simply output the \texttt{CSV} files into the same folder 
as the input files, and just add an additional \texttt{.csv} 
extension to their original name.

<<echo = FALSE,eval=TRUE>>= 
#   Clean-up the files created above (ignore this)
out <- unlink( x = fOut )
rm( out, fOut, f, dirOut, fDir )
@ 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Import binary files into R (\texttt{macroReadBin})} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Graphical user interface} 

If you want to import one or several binary files into R (as 
\texttt{data.frame}), simply type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
tbl <- macroReadBin() 
@ 


And the binary file will be read and saved into the R object 
\texttt{tbl} (you can choose any name you like, if it is not 
an existing R function or reserved character).\\

If you have chosen one file, \texttt{tbl} will be a single 
\texttt{data.frame}. If you have chosen several file, \texttt{tbl} 
will be a \texttt{list} of \texttt{data.frame}s. Each table in 
that list can then be retrieved individually, for example:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
tmp[[ 1 ]] 
@ 

will fetch the first table in the list. Notice this won't work if 
you have chosen only one file.\\

Check \texttt{?data.frame} and \texttt{?"[.data.frame"} to understand 
what \texttt{data.frame}s are and how they can be subset (out of 
the scope of this tutorial).



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{R commands (non-interactive mode)} 

In non-interactive mode, you can type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
tbl <- macroReadBin( 
    f = "output_chat_winCer_Met-GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin" ) 
@ 


and then, for example, inspect this table:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
## Class:
class( tbl ) 
## 
## First rows: 
head( tbl )
## 
## Last rows: 
tail( tbl ) 
## 
## Dimentions:
dim( tbl ) 
## 
## Column names:
colnames( tbl ) 
@ 


Additional parameters can be changed to modify 
the way binary files are processed and how column names are 'sanitised'. 
The default behaviour is now to replace sucessive spaces by single 
underscore, to remove non-alpha-numeric symbols and to remove the 
simulation ID if it is present. For example:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>=   
#   Read the binary file
tbl <- macroReadBin( 
    f = "output_chat_winCer_Met-GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin", 
    rmSpaces = FALSE ) 

#   Look at column names (notice the spaces):
colnames( tbl ) 
@ 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Plot variables from binary files (\texttt{macroPlot})} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Graphical user interface} 

Simply type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroPlot() 
@ 


... and follow the instructions that appear on the screen, first 
as a pop-up window to choose the file(s) you want to plot, and 
then as a of text menu asking you some details about the plot you 
want to produce:\\

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Which variables you want to plot. This is asked for each 
        binary file you have chosen. You can choose several of them;
    \item If you want all the variables in one single plot, or in 
        distinc sub-plots. 
    \item If you want to zoom-in (or zoom-out), to view a narrower 
        time window in the time-series.
    \item These questions are asked over and over, until you 
        terminate the function (or press the \texttt{ESC} key).
\end{itemize} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{R commands (non-interactive mode)} 

If you want to use \texttt{macroPlot} in a non-interactive way, 
it is necessary to import some binary file(s) first:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>= 
tbl <- macroReadBin( 
    f = "output_chat_winCer_Met-GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin" ) 
## 
## Look at it:
colnames( tbl ) 
dim( tbl ) 
@ 


Now the data can be plotted. We will choose only the first two 
variables here (+ the Date column):

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig=TRUE>>= 
macroPlot( x = tbl[, 1:3 ], gui = FALSE ) 
@ 


Another way to look at the same dataset:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig=TRUE>>= 
macroPlot( x = tbl[, 1:3 ], gui = FALSE, subPlot = FALSE ) 
@ 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Binary files visualiser, as tabular data (\texttt{macroViewBin})} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsubsection{Graphical user interface} 

\texttt{macroutils2} also includes a rudimentary binary file 
viewer. It is a wrapper around R function \texttt{View}, wich 
includes a file chooser.

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroViewBin() 
@ 


You may also type:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
macroViewBin( "output_chat_winCer_GW-C_1kgHa_d298.bin" ) 
@ 


Next figure show what the viewer looks like.\\

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{macroViewBin.png} 



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Export R tables as binary files (\texttt{macroWriteBin})} 

\textit{TO BE WRITTEN}. Check \texttt{?macroWriteBin}, it presents 
some examples.\\

Notice that this function has not been tested extensively yet (i.e. 
we have not tried to run MACRO with files written with this function!).



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Time aggregation of data imported from a binary file (\texttt{macroAggregateBin})} 

\textit{TO BE WRITTEN}. Check \texttt{?macroAggregateBin}, it 
presents some examples.



% +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
\subsection{Reading the functions' help pages} 

The functions' in this package are documented quite extensively. 
You can access the help pages menu of this package by typing the 
command:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
help( package = "macroutils2" ) 
@ 


NB: This will open a help page in a web-browser.\\

To view the help page of a specific function, for example 
\texttt{macroReadBin}, type: 

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
help( "macroReadBin" ) 
# OR
?macroReadBin
@ 


Just change the function's name to view the help page of another 
function.\\

Experienced R users may also have a look at the actual code executed 
by each function by typing their names, without the parenthesis. 
For (a short) example:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>= 
getMuPar 
@ 


The \texttt{macroutils2:::getMuPar} method is mostly useful 
for functions that are hidden from the end-user (often names 
starting with a \texttt{.} are hidden).

\subsection{Bugs and improvements} 

Please report us any bug you may find in this package. When reporting 
bugs, please:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make sure the bug is occuring in \texttt{soilmacoutils}, 
        and is not due to errors in your \texttt{R} code or due to 
        a wrong usage of the package (typically a wrong object 
        class passed to a \texttt{soilmacoutils} function).
    \item Read the function's documentation before reporting any 
        problem;
    \item Make sure the file you are trying to read is located in 
        the working directory (see \texttt{getwd()}), unless the 
        file path is provided with the file name. 
    \item Send us the binary file that cause the problem, or any 
        binary file on which the problem occur (or a sub-part of it).
    \item Send us a concise \textbf{reproducible code example} that 
        display the problem you are facing. That should use the above 
        mentioned binary file you send to us. A reproducible code 
        example is a code sniplet that can be executed on any 
        computer with the same R and the same \texttt{soilmacoutils} 
        version.
    \item As in the sub-section below ("Session info"), provide us 
        you \texttt{sessionInfo()} and \texttt{soilmacoutils} 
        version. 
    \item If needed, find help from a local R expert at your workplace 
        to provide such reproducible example.
\end{itemize}

A reproducible example is mandatory for an bug-fix demand, as we 
need to be able to exactly reproduce the problem ourselves to be 
able to fix the problem.\\

If you notice any error or approximation in this manual, comments 
are also very welcome.\\

Suggestions of improvements are very welcome, but keep in mid they 
may only be implemented if they prove useful to many users and if 
we have time and ressources to implement them.
