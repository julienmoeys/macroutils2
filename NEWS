    R package: macroutils2

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.2
    
   2019/03/26  macroutilsFocusGWConc() argument "output_lower_bound"
        was changed to two arguments "output_water" and 
        "output_solute" to finely tune whether the report 
        should include the target layer, the lower boundary 
        or both.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.1
    
    2018/12/26  macroutilsFocusGWConc() has now a new argument 
        "output_lower_bound". default behaviour is now to return 
        water percolating at the lower boundary of the profile, 
        but neither solute mass flow nor a PEC for the lower 
        boundary (i.e. like in MACRO In FOCUS), so the user 
        does not pick the wrong PEC.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
    
    2018/11/19  All example/test binary files were updated.
        FOCUS dummy substance GW-C was replaced by GW-D with 
        application every year, every other year or every third 
        year, so these configurations are tested too.
        
    2018/11/21  In macroutilsFocusGWConc(), use signif() 
        instead of own code to round 
        concentrations like MACRO In FOCUS user interface, 
        i.e. with 3 significant figures rather than a number 
        of digits after the decimal mark.
        
    2018/12/06  Removed non-essential tests (comparison between 
        bin-files imported by macroutils2 and converted by 
        MACRO 5.2, for biennial and triennial application 
        intervals). This saves space in the binary-package and 
        is covered by the test for annual application.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.2
    
    2018/11/17  Small bug fix in macroutilsFocusGWConc, 
        formatting of an error message.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.1
    
    2018/11/08  In macroutilsFocusGWConc():
        *   Fixed NaN values in the output of the fraction of 
            solute in the micropores or macropores when 
            the total solute flow was 0.
        *   Now also exports concentrations rounded like 
            in MACRO In FOCUS, in an attempt to get comparable 
            results (rounded to 2 digits after the decimal mark
            when displayed in scientific mode)
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.0
    
    2018/10/31  
        macroInFocusGWConc() renamed macroutilsFocusGWConc()
        
        macroutilsFocusGWConc() now outputs a list of data.frame.
        The new output format is documented.
        
        macroutilsFocusGWConc() now has an agrument "massunits" 
        to account for the fact that MACRO results may be 
        produced with different mass units (argument MASSUNITS 
        in MACRO).
        
        In all relevant functions (macroReadBin; macroWriteBin; 
        macroConvertBin; macroViewBin), 
        the argument "file" has been renamed "f" to avoid 
        clashes with the function file().
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.1
    
    2018/09/21  Added a new possible value for argument 
        'method' in macroInFocusGWConc(). If set to "test" 
        the function will even work on short simulations 
        used for functional tests.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0

    2018/08/27  Clone of the macroutils package created, 
        with the name macroutils2. The aim of macroutils2 
        is to make the source code stand in a single R-file 
        that can be loaded with one call to source(). This 
        is necessary for enabling development and debugging 
        on computers that do not include the R-infrastructure 
        for package development.
        
    2018/09/04  macroReadBin now reads MACRO intermediate-files
        for metabolites.
        
        macroReadBin now sets automatically the number of years 
        on which average concentrations are calculated (for 
        annual, biennial or triennial application frequencies).
        
    2018/09/11  A more generic and customisable method for 
        reading bib-files headers (column names) has been 
        implemented. The method is not 100 percent perfect, 
        but generic, and it is possible to not perform any 
        header cleaning, or to trim the column names to a 
        fixed number of characters (known before hand).
        
        The example bin-files have been replaced by 
        non-copyrighted ones (MACRO In FOCUS input and output)
        in order to avoid problems with the new licence terms 
        (MIT).
    
    2018/09/14  The output of macroInFocusGWConc() has been 
        clarified and now only exports concentrations 
        calculated with one method (FOCUS or R percentile, 
        default to FOCUS).
        
        The default tests (in the folder tests/) have been 
        updated and improved.
        
    2018/09/18  The function macroutilsInfo() was removed 
        from the package.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.0
    
    2017/10/02   Compile for R 3.3.2
        
        Implement a new function, macroInFocusGWConc2(). 
        It is a variante of macroInFocusGWConc() that 
        can account for pesticide application every 
        1, 2, 3, ... year, and calculation of yearly, 
        biennial, triennial, ... average-concentrations.
        Does not replace the calculation performed 
        by the official FOCUS-tools.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.14.0
    
    2016/06/08  Compile for R 3.3.0 (test)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.0
    
    2016/02/12  macroReadIndump() now also returns a table 
        with the variables' index (in the indump.tmp)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.1
    
    2016/01/27  Fix a bug in muPar() that prevented parameter 
        values to be set to NULL. In principle no parameter 
        was concerned (as no parameter need to be set to 
        NULL), so this bug had no effects.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.0

    2015/12/08  macroBugFixCleanDb() now issues a warning 
        message if not run in R 32 bit (i386), as RODBC 
        for MS Access works (only?) with R 32 bit.
        
        macroBugFixCleanDb() now also attempts to fix a 
        bug that appear when increasing (changing) the 
        number of numerical layers. It seems some values 
        in the parameter table `OutputLayers` (new numerical 
        layers) have their column `Selected` empty, instead 
        of 0 or 1. The bug fix will also attempt to fix 
        value in `OutputLayers` that are present despite 
        the parameter in `Output()` having selected set 
        to 0.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.0
    
    2015/11/02  macroInFocusGWConc() now calculates the 
        mass fraction of the pesticide flow that is 
        due to micropore or/versus macropore transport.
        This experimental feature aims at estimating the 
        importance of macropore flow in the calculated 
        concentration.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.1
    
    2015/10/09  macroInFocusGWConc() now checks for negative 
        concentrations in the 80th percentile (or can set 
        negative concentrations to 0)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0
    
    2015/10/09  Implemented more strict tests / benchmarks 
        between macroReadBin() and bin-file conversion 
        performed by MACRO 5.2. Should be able to detect 
        unwanted accidental changes in macroReadBin() 
        (at least in terms of numerical accuracy)
        
        Also included a simple benchmark in macroInFocusGWConc()
        on concentration and percolation.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0
    
    2015/10/08  Added the function macroInFocusGWConc() 
        to calculate pesticide concentrations from MACROInFOCUS 
        output bin file(s). Internal and experimental.
    
CHANGE SIN VERSION 1.8.4
    
    2015/09/23  Added an 'overwrite' agument to 
        macroConvertBin(), and fixed a bug that caused an 
        interactive question to be asked to the user even 
        when 'gui' was FALSE and the output files already 
        existed. Now if 'overwrite' is FALSE and 'gui' is 
        TRUE a question is asked to the user, and otherwise 
        if 'gui' is FALSE and 'overwrite' is FALSE, an 
        error is issued when files already exists.
    
        A sub-section was added in the vignette that describes 
        how to perform a batch conversion of files with 
        macroConvertBin(), including listing all the bin 
        files in a folder.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.3

    2015/07/23  Added the function isValidTimeSeries(), used
        internally to check that time series read from or 
        written to BIN-files are consistent (increasing, 
        homogeneous increment and no duplicated values).
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.2
    
    2015/04/17  Compiled for R 3.2.0 RC (2015-04-15 r68178).
    
        Cleaned-up internal call to library() or require() 
        and use :: instead (+ Depends or Suggests or Import 
        fields in package DESCRIPTION)
    
    2015/05/04  Compiled for R 3.2.0 Official release.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.1
    
    2015/03/17  Moved from a local SVN to a public git (GitHub) 
        repository. Last SVN version was 18:52M (macroutils 1.8.0)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
    
    2015/03/17  From now on macroutils will contain only "official" 
        MACRO routines and utilities, and the routines related 
        to crop growth (under development) have been moved to 
        another R package, macrocrop (not publicly released).
        
        macroutils was split for SVN version "18:50M" (macroutils 
        version 1.7.4).
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.4
    
    2014/12/08  Bug fix in macroLAI()
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3

    2014/09/28  Compiled for R 3.1.1
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2

    2014/07/03  Added the function macroutilsInfo() that fetches 
        and return a rather comprehensive report on system info 
        and package(s) version(s) and MD5, either for macroutils 
        or for any other package
        
        SVN revision is now displayed when the package is attached
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.1
    
    2014/05/28 to 2014/06/03    Attempts to improve the LAI-calculations 
        for multiple crops. Did not work in some cases.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0
    
    2014/05/26  Now macroLAI() can handle a data.frame of 
        crop parameters (multiple crops).
        
        Parameter "Date" in macroLAI() renamed 'x'
        
        macroIntercept() parameters now simplified
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.2
    
    2014/05/22  fixed a bug in macroLAI() and macroRootDepth() 
        and macroRootDensity(): parameters iharv and laiharv renamed 
        iharv and laihar (now correct)
        
        bug fix: macroPlot() was not always identifying correctly 
            when given a list of data.frame to plot
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.1
    
    2014/05/22  macroPlot() now includes a parameter 'z' for 
        pre-selecting the variables to include in the graph
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0

    2014/05/15  Included macroLAI() and macroIntercept() to calculate 
        total and green LAI a-la-MACRO and the fraction of irrigation 
        water intercepted by the crop vegetation.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0

    2014/05/12  Included macroRootDepth() and macroRootDensity(), 
        functions to estimate root depth and density as in 
        MACRO

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
    
    2014/05/12  Included a bug-fix for MACRO GUI parameter database, 
        macroBugFixCleanDb(), that remove orphan and duplicated 
        values in the table `Output()`. Might be deleted when 
        the bug has been fixed in MACRO GUI.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
    
    2014/03/19
        
        macroReadBin() now output macroTimeSeries or 
        macroTimeSeriesList objects (class), instead of 
        macroData and macroDataList
        
        Some functions made S3 generic and S3 methods, to favour 
        future extensions.
        
        macroPlot() created, generic and method function to plot 
        macroTimeSeries and macroTimeSeriesList, as well 
        as bin files (with GUI). Superseeds macroPlotBin() 
        
        A bug was fixed in macroPlot() background grid, which 
        were not displayed at the right place on the X-axis, 
        because of the POSIXct time format (incompatible with 
        grid()).
        
        macroPlot() now uses a ggplot2-style for axes, grid and 
        background color.
        
        macroPlot() now uses hcl() to generate default variable 
        colors (it looks nicer)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0 (labelled 1.1.7) 
 
    2012/11/16 New option system, smuPar() and getSmuPar() 
              SMU.readBin() now has much less arguments.
              
              SMU.plot() now has a "menu" to change the 
              variables plotted, the plot style, or to 
              zoom in and out.
              
              The file chooser in the GUI now remembers 
              the last location.
              
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6 
 
    2012/11/15 Corrected a bug in SMU.plot() occuring when 
              only one variable was selected

    2012/11/14 SMU.readBin() and SMU.plot() now have a complete 
              GUI (simple, but portable). 
    
              SMU.plot() have been changed heavily, and 
              does not rely any more on 'ggplot2'.
    
              SMU.rmRunID() becomes .SMU.rmRunID() 
              (hidden)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4 

    2012/05/10 Added SMU.rmRunID to remove Run ID from MACRO 
              results column names. Also as an option in 
              SMU.readBin

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3 and before

    2010/09/08 Version 1.0 of the package. Documented.

    2011/10/19 Added a "header" argument to SMU.readBin and 
              SMU.writeBin so weather files without header 
              can be read.
